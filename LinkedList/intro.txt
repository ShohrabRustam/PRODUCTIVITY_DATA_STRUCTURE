Problem with Array?
    
    1. Array have fixed length/size
    2. whenever we are creating a new array we have to mention the size
    of the array and later on we can not increase the size/decrease 
    the size of the array.So once created remains same.
    3.if we take random size that size may be insufficient or accessed.

Differences between Array and LinkedList?
