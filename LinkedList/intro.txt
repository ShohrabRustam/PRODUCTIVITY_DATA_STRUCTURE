Problem with Array?
    
    1. Array have fixed length/size
    2. whenever we are creating a new array we have to mention the size
    of the array and later on we can not increase the size/decrease 
    the size of the array.So once created remains same.
    3.if we take random size that size may be insufficient or accessed.

Differences between Array and LinkedList?

    1.data structre which should grow and reduce the size.
    2.variable size data structre which should grow and reduce the size.
    3.must create the memory in head during run time.
    4.we should linking for making LinkedList.
    5.remove and insert operations are easy.
    6.more flexible than array.
    
What is LinkedList?
    LinkedList is a collection of Nodes.
    Where Each Node contains data and pointer
    to next node.
