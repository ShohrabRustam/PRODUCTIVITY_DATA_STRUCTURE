Tree: a tree in computer science is indeed a collection of nodes 
        (also sometimes referred to as vertices) that are connected 
        by edges. These nodes represent elements in the tree, 
        and the edges define the hierarchical relationships between them.

if there a (N) Node/Nodes then there will be (N-1) edge/edges.
