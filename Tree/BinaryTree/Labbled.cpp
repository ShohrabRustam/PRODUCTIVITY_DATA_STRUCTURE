Number of binary tree can be generated with N nodes:


    2. Labbled Nodes

Unlabbled Nodes:    
            Number of Binary tree 

    T(n) = 2nCn/n+1; its famous as Catalon Number

    T(n) = Catalon Number = 2nCn/n+1 * 3!

   number of maximum height tree: 2^n-1

   Catalon Formula = sum(i,n) => T(i-1) * T(n-i);
