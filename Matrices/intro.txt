Special Matrix: Special Matrix are square matrix where diamension is n*n.
it contain more number of zero elements if there are more number of zero elements
then we can handle them Specially and store only non-zero elements and avoid 
storage of zero elements.
So that space and computational time can be saved.

Type of Special Matrix
    1.Diagonal Matrix
    2.Lower Triangular Matrix
    3.Upper Triangular Matrix
    4.Symmetric Matrix
    5.TriDiagonal Matrix
    6.Band Matrix
    7.Toeptitz Matrix
    8.Sparse Matrix
