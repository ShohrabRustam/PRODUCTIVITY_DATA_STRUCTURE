        """
            DATA STRUCTURE can be define as arrangement of collections of 
            data.so that data can be used effiently.

    TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURE :
        
        HERE DATA STRUCTURE ARE TWO TYPES:
            1. PHYSICAL DATA STRUCTURE
            2. LOGICAL DATA STRUCTURE
    
    1. PHYSICAL DATA STRUCTURE:
        THERE ARE TWO DATA STRUCTURE
            I. ARRAY 
            II. LINKED LIST 
        
        WHY WE ARE CALLING AS PHYSICAL DATA STRUCTURE ?
        
        """
            THESE DATA STRUCTURE DESIDES/DEFINE "HOW MEMORY ORGANIZE/ALLOCATED"
        """
    
    I. ARRAY : 
    
    """ 
    # THIS IS SUPPORTED BY PRGRAMMING LANGUAGES LIKE C,JAVA,CPP
    
    # ARRAY CAN BE DEFINE AS COLLECTION OF SIMMILAR DATA TYPE 
        IN CONTIGIOUS MEMORY ALLOCATION.
    
    # ARRAY HAS FIXED SIZE ONCE ITS CREATED THAT SIZE CAN NOT BE CHANGED.
    
    # ARRAY CAN BE CREATED INSIDE STACK OR HEAP.
    """

    II. LINKED LIST : 
        
        """
            LINKED LIST IS COLLECTION OF NODE AND EACH NODE CONTAIN DATA 
            AND LINK TO NEXT NODE.
            
            THE LENGTH OF LIST CAN GROW AND REDUCE. 

            COLLECTION OF NODE [LINKED LIST] ALWAYS CREATED IN HEAP MEMORY.

        """

    2. LOGICAL DATA STRUCTURE:
    
    """
        DECIPLINE DEFINE TO THE PHYSICAL DATA STRUCTURE KNOW AS 
        LOGICAL DATA STRUCTURE.
    """

    THE LIST OF LOGICAL DATA STRUCTURE IS GIVEN BELOW
            
        I. STACK [LIFO] [LAST IN FIRST OUT ]
        II. QUEUE [FIFO] [FIRST IN FIRST OUT]
        III. TREES
        IV. GRAPH [COLLECTION OF NODE AND LINKS BETWEEN THE NODES]
        V. HASH TABLE

    # STACK AND QUEUE ARE LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE
    # TREE AND GRAPH ARE NON LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE
    # HASH MAY BE LINEAR OR TABULAR DATA STRUCTURE
